         <h3>2.Geological Cause</h3>      
         <p>Nepal is located on the convergent boundary between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate.
            The Indian Plate is moving northward and pushing underneath the Eurasian Plate, a process called subduction.
            This tectonic movement builds pressure over time, which was released suddenly in the form of this powerful earthquake.
            Problem:Nepalâ€™s location in a highly seismic zone makes it prone to future earthquakes.</p>
